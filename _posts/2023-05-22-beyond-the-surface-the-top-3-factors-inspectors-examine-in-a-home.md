When it comes to buying or selling a home, one crucial step in the process is the inspection. Home inspectors play a vital role in assessing the condition of a property and identifying any potential issues that may affect its value. Here are the top three things that inspectors look for during a property inspection:

**1\. Water intrusion and roofing.** A major concern for any homeowner is water intrusion. Inspectors thoroughly examine the property for any signs of leaks, damaged or missing shingles, and moss growth. Additionally, they pay close attention to the flashing, gutters, vents, attic ventilation, and skylights. Ensuring that these components are watertight can prevent significant problems down the line. If any issues are found, it is crucial to address them promptly to avoid costly repairs.

**2\. Structural integrity.** A solid foundation is essential for the long-term stability of a home. Inspectors carefully inspect the foundation for cracks or signs of water damage to the siding or supports. Windows are also included in this category, as they contribute to the overall structural integrity of the property. The inspector will examine all windows to ensure they are in good condition and functioning properly.

**3\. Utilities.** The functionality and safety of the utilities within a home are of utmost importance. Inspectors thoroughly assess the HVAC system, plumbing, and electrical systems. They check for any signs of wear and tear, damage, or potential safety compromises. If any issues are detected, it is essential to determine the cost of repairing or replacing them. As a buyer's agent, we advise our clients to pay close attention to safety items and significant repairs that may cost over $500.
