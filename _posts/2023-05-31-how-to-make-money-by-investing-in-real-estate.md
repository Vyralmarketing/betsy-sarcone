How much do you know about the power of investing in real estate? The truth is that this avenue can be very lucrative and help you build long-term wealth. However, know upfront that this type of investing is much more about the long game, and you’ll need to be patient. The sooner you start, the more you can earn.&nbsp;

Over the years, people have gotten their start in real estate investing in various ways. Some people have rented out part of their homes, lived with their families a little longer, and worked extra hours to save up enough to start investing. However you make it work, know that the initial work is worth it.

There are a thousand different ways you can save money; you just need to get your start. Be educated on the industry, then begin because, as I said, the sooner you start, the better. Once you decide to invest, there are three main ways you can take your investment:&nbsp;

**1\. Buy and hold.** This is the most traditional method. Over time, appreciation will mean that your property goes up in value. You can save up this equity; all you have to do is wait for it to grow.&nbsp;

**2\. Flipping.** This method requires more work, but you can buy a fixer-upper property that has high-return potential, then take the time to fix it up. Once it's in better condition, you can sell it for much more than what you bought it for. You just have to know how to get the renovations done and ensure profit.&nbsp;

**3\. Short- or long-term rentals.** You can buy a property and have a tenant in it for a year or more or focus on short-term rentals on sites like Airbnb or Vrbo. These are mainly for vacation rentals and are best in tourist destinations. You’ll just need to know the laws of the area and put in the work to be the landlord.&nbsp;

Whatever you decide to do, just make sure to be educated and not do it alone. This was just a short crash course, but I would be happy to share my knowledge and help you through the process of building wealth through investing in real estate.
